# tinder_swipper

A simple Tinder swipe right script, it uses google authentication in order to log into your Tinder profile 
and keeps swipping right for eternity (that is, if you get Tinder+ of course).

It handles Tinder+/Tinder gold random modal popups, and the modal popups for matches.

Installation:

  pip install selenium python-decouple


To run it:

py main.py
